# Covey.Town Frontend App

This frontend is created using the [create react app](https://create-react-app.dev) toolchain. You
can start a development server by running `npm start`. To create a production build, run
`npm run build`.

The README section contains detailed instructions to deploy the application with your new feature -
modified from our initial installation instructions to include any new setup necessary for your
feature. The course staff is able to follow these instructions to deploy your application. The
README section is at most 2 pages (fewer pages are absolutely acceptable, consider this a rough
limit)

Process for Deploying the Application on Local Machine is the same as the original instructions: 0)
To Deploy the application, one must have both the front end and the back end running. To do so:

1. Open a terminal window and cd to directory: frontend
2. run following commands: npm install > npm run start
3. Open another separate terminal window and cd to directory: services/townService
4. run following commands: npm install > npm run start
